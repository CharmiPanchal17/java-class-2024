There are two main types of data types in java;
1. primitive datatype- these store actual value, more memory efficient and are faster to access.
                       there are 8 main types under primitive;
                       - boolean
                       - byte
                       - short
                       - long
                       - int
                       - float
                       - double
                       - char

2. reference datatype- these store memory addresses and complex objects and share data across different program parts.
                        under reference we have;
                        - strings
                        - arrays
